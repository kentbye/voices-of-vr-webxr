# Voices of VR WebXR
A collaboration of WebXR developers who are prototyping and experimenting with the data set from the Voices of VR to help imagine and create the future of the immersive web.

## Goals 
* Experiment with how immersive web technologies like WebXR, Three.js, or Babylon.js can be used to navigate the archive of Voices of VR podcast episodes.
* Provide access to raw data for immersive web developers to experiment with the affordances of the spatial web with the spirit of sharing those innovations back into some emerging spatial infrastructure of the Voices of VR, but also more broadly provide design inspiration for the broader web community as to the power and potential of WebXR.
* Migrate the Voices of VR podcast website to a CMS that can deliver both a podcast RSS feed, a 2D browsing experience on mobile, but also a JSON file that enables the exploration of connections between episodes. 
* Explore how network graphs can start to form a spatialized information architecture within content management systems.
* Explore how spatial interfaces can be used for the discovery of podcast episodes that can be selected and exported into an RSS feed for offline listening.
* Explore how individuals can potential create their own playlists or tags with this data.
* Experiment with how virtual architecture that is authored and designed can be melded with emergent architecture from a variety of network visualization tools.

## TODO
* Figure out best practices for how to structure this GitHub repo in order to facilitate collaboration.
* Should there be a section of meeting notes to help document the experimentation process?
* Finish tagging the Voices of VR episodes and clean up the data
* Migrate Voices of VR 2D website from Wordpress to Drupal
* Automate the production of the JSON files

## Things others can help dig into and investigate
* Are there AI transcription services that could be used to provide transcripts for previous episodes?
